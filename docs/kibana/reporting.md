# Reporting

The Open Distro for Elasticsearch Kibana reporting feature lets you create PNG, PDF, and CSV reports. To use reporting, you must have the correct permissions.


## Create reports from Discovery, Visualize, or Dashboard

On-demand reports let you quickly generate a report from the current view.

1. From the top bar, choose **Reporting**.
1. For dashboards or visualizations, **Download PDF** or **Download PNG**. From the Discover page, choose **Download CSV**.

   Reports generate asynchronously in the background and might take a few minutes, depending on the size of the report. A notification appears when your report is ready to download.

1. To create a schedule-based report, choose **Create report definition**. Then proceed to [Create reports using a definition](#create-reports-using-a-definition). This option pre-fills many of the fields for you based on the visualization, dashboard, or data you were viewing.


## Create reports using a definition

Definitions let you schedule reports for periodic creation.

1. From the left navigation panel, choose **Reporting**.
1. Choose **Create**.
1. Under **Report settings**, enter a name and optional description for your report.
1. Choose the **Report Source** (i.e. the page from which the report is generated). You can generate reports from the **Dashboard**, **Visualize** or **Discover** pages.
1. Choose your dashboard, visualization, or saved search. Then choose a time range for the report.
1. Choose an appropriate file format for the report.
1. (Optional) Add a header or footer for the report. Headers and footers are only available for dashboard or visualization reports.
1. Under **Report trigger**, choose either **On-demand** or **Schedule**.

   For scheduled reports, choose either **Recurring** or **Cron based**. You can receive reports daily or at some other time interval. Cron expressions give you even more flexiblity. See [Cron expression reference](../../alerting/cron/) for more information.

1. Choose **Create**.
