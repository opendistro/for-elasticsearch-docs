# Kibana notebooks (experimental)

Kibana notebooks have a known issue with [tenants](../../security/access-control/multi-tenancy/). If you open a notebook and can't see its visualizations, you might be under the wrong tenant, or you might not have access to the tenant at all.

A Kibana notebook is an interface that lets you easily combine live visualizations and narrative text in a single notebook interface.

With Kibana notebooks, you can interactively explore data by running different visualizations and share your work with team members to collaborate on a project.

A notebook is a document composed of two elements: Kibana visualizations and paragraphs (Markdown). Choose multiple timelines to compare and contrast visualizations.

Common use cases include creating postmortem reports, designing runbooks, building live infrastructure reports, and writing documentation.
