# Previous versions

This page includes documentation and download links for old versions of Open Distro for Elasticsearch OSS.


## Old documentation versions

We host certain old versions of the documentation---typically the final minor release for a given major release---in case you want to get started with a prior version of Open Distro for Elasticsearch.

We do *not* backport bug fixes to old versions of the documentation, so even if you use a prior version of Open Distro, the current version of the documentation might be the most useful, accurate resource.

- [Open Distro 1.11.0 documentation](https://opendistro.github.io/for-elasticsearch-docs/old/1.11.0/){:target='\_blank'}
- [Open Distro 0.9.0 documentation](https://opendistro.github.io/for-elasticsearch-docs/old/0.9.0/){:target='\_blank'}


Open Distro for Elasticsearch OSS is no longer being developed and no longer available for download. Please visit [OpenSearch documentation](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/#) to learn about upgrading to OpenSearch and getting started with our improved open source solution.
