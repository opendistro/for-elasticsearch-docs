# Backend configuration

One of the first steps to using the Security plugin is to decide on an authentication backend, which handles [steps 2-3 of the authentication flow](../concepts#authentication-flow). The plugin has an internal user database, but many people prefer to use an existing authentication backend, such as an LDAP server, or some combination of the two.
