# Metrics reference

This page contains all Performance Analyzer metrics. All metrics support the `avg`, `sum`, `min`, and `max` aggregations, although certain metrics measure only one thing, making the choice of aggregation irrelevant.

For information on dimensions, see the [dimensions reference](#dimensions-reference).

This list is extensive. We recommend Ctrl + F to find what you're looking for.

## Dimensions reference

Dimension | Return values
:--- | :---
ShardID | ID for the shard (e.g. `1`).
IndexName | Name of the index (e.g. `my-index`).
Operation | Type of operation (e.g. `shardbulk`).
ShardRole | `primary`, `replica`
Exception | Elasticsearch exceptions (e.g. `org.elasticsearch.index_not_found_exception`).
Indices | The list of indices in the request URI.
HTTPRespCode | Response code from Elasticsearch (e.g. `200`).
MemType | `totYoungGC`, `totFullGC`, `Survivor`, `PermGen`, `OldGen`, `Eden`, `NonHeap`, `Heap`
DiskName | Name of the disk (e.g. `sda1`).
DestAddr | Destination address (e.g. `010015AC`).
Direction | `in`, `out`
ThreadPoolType | The Elasticsearch thread pools (e.g. `index`, `search`,`snapshot`).
CBType | `accounting`, `fielddata`, `in_flight_requests`, `parent`, `request`
MasterTaskInsertOrder | The order in which the task was inserted (e.g. `3691`).
MasterTaskPriority | Priority of the task (e.g. `URGENT`). Elasticsearch executes higher priority tasks before lower priority ones, regardless of `insert_order`.
