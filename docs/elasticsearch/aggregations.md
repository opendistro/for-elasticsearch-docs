# Aggregations

Elasticsearch isn’t just for search. Aggregations let you tap into Elasticsearch's powerful analytics engine to analyze your data and extract statistics from it.

The use cases of aggregations vary from analyzing data in real time to take some action to using Kibana to create a visualization dashboard.

Elasticsearch can perform aggregations on massive datasets in milliseconds. Compared to queries, aggregations consume more CPU cycles and memory.

## Aggregations on text fields

By default, Elasticsearch does not support aggregations on a text field.
Because text fields are tokenized, an aggregation on a text field has to reverse the tokenization process back to its original string and then formulate an aggregation based on that. Such an operation consumes significant memory and degrades cluster performance.

While you can enable aggregations on text fields by setting the `fielddata` parameter to `true` in the mapping, the aggregations are still based on the tokenized words and not on the raw text.

We recommend keeping a raw version of the text field as a keyword field that you can aggregate on.
In this case, you can perform aggregations on the `title.raw` field, instead of the `title` field:

```json
PUT movies
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "title": {
        "type": "text",
        "fielddata": true,
        "fields": {
          "raw": {
            "type": "keyword"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## General aggregation structure

The structure of an aggregation query is as follows:

```json
GET _search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "NAME": {
      "AGG_TYPE": {}
    }
  }
}
```

If you’re only interested in the aggregation result and not in the results of the query, set `size` to 0.

In the `aggs` property (you can use aggregations if you want), you can define any number of aggregations.
Each aggregation is defined by its name and one of the types of aggregations that Elasticsearch supports.

The name of the aggregation helps you to distinguish between different aggregations in the response.
The `AGG_TYPE` property is where you specify the type of aggregation.

## Sample aggregation

This section uses the Kibana sample e-commerce data and web log data. To add the sample data, log in to Kibana, choose **Home** and **Try our sample data**. For **Sample eCommerce orders** and **Sample web logs**, choose **Add data**.

### avg

To find the average value of the `taxful_total_price` field:

```json
GET kibana_sample_data_ecommerce/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "avg_taxful_total_price": {
      "avg": {
        "field": "taxful_total_price"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Sample response

```json
{
  "took" : 1,
  "timed_out" : false,
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 1,
    "successful" : 1,
    "skipped" : 0,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "hits" : {
    "total" : {
      "value" : 4675,
      "relation" : "eq"
    },
    "max_score" : null,
    "hits" : [ ]
  },
  "aggregations" : {
    "avg_taxful_total_price" : {
      "value" : 75.05542864304813
    }
  }
}
```

The aggregation block in the response shows the average value for the `taxful_total_price` field.

## Types of aggregations

There are three main types of aggregations:

- Metric aggregations - Calculate metrics such as `sum`, `min`, `max`, and `avg` on numeric fields.
- Bucket aggregations - Sort query results into groups based on some criteria.
- Pipeline aggregations - Pipe the output of one aggregation as an input to another.

## Nested aggregations

Metric aggregations produce simple results and cannot contain nested aggregations.
On the other hand, bucket aggregations produce buckets of documents that you can use for other aggregations.
You could have bucket aggregations within other bucket aggregations. Also, referred to as nested or sub aggregations.
You can perform complex analysis on your data by nesting metric and bucket aggregations within bucket aggregations. You can add nested aggregations to any number of levels.

## General nested aggregation syntax

```json
{
  "aggs": {
    "name": {
      "type": {
        "data"
      },
      "aggs": {
        "nested": {
          "type": {
            "data"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The inner `aggs` keyword begins a new aggregation known as a nested or sub-aggregation. The syntax of the parent aggregation and the nested-aggregation is the same. Nested-aggregations run in the context of the previous level's aggregations.

You can also pair your aggregations with search queries to narrow down things you’re trying to analyze before aggregating. If you don't add a query, Elasticsearch implicitly uses the `match_all` query.
